			<h3>Our Most Important Belief</h3>
			<p>&nbsp;Our most important belief is in the Good News of Jesus Christ, known as the Everlasting Gospel. The good news is that God came to this planet 2,000 years ago in the person of Jesus Christ. Jesus lived a perfect, obedient life and never sinned. He was fully God and fully man. His life and teachings were the most complete revelation we have of the personality, love, and character of God. Jesus showed us what God is like. His life is recorded in what is called the New Testament.

Jesus offered His life on the cross and allowed himself to be counted guilty for every wrong act and thought committed by every human being who was ever born into this world, from Adam to the last child born.

Because of His gracious act of dying for the whole world, God raised up Jesus on the third day. He appeared to many people who, as a result, became convinced that He was alive. The Scriptures tell us that He ascended back into Heaven, where He presently mediates as our Advocate until His promised return to this world again in these last days. At that time, all sin will be finally put away forever and there will be a new Heaven and a new Earth.

			</p>
			<p>A personal relationship with Jesus begins with accepting His 
			death on the cross for yourself and allowing Him to be the Lord of 
			your life. When we believe this, we are declared righteous before 
			God and it is as if we had never sinned. The believer is adopted as 
			His child. Then we are baptized by immersion, which is the visible 
			symbol of this spiritual birth and our new relationship with God. 
			There is a mysterious change that occurs in the human heart that 
			comes about only by the power of the Holy Spirit. To permit this to 
			happen is the most important step that any human being can take in 
			this mortal life. To resist this wooing of God in your heart to join 
			His family is eternally dangerous. Without this clear, fundamental 
			understanding of what the Gospel (or Good News) of Jesus Christ 
			really is, nothing else we could tell you would make any sense. Read

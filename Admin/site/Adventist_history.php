			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; outline: none; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			In just a century and a half the Seventh-day Adventist Church has 
			grown from a handful of individuals, who carefully studied the Bible 
			in their search for truth, to a world-wide community of over eight 
			million members and millions of others who regard the Adventist 
			Church their spiritual home. Doctrinally, Seventh-day Adventists are 
			heirs of the interfaith Millerite movement of the 1840s. Although 
			the name &quot;Seventh-day Adventist&quot; was chosen in 1860, the 
			denomination was not officially organized until May 21, 1863, when 
			the movement included some 125 churches and 3,500 members.</p>
			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			Between 1831 and 1844, William Miller--a Baptist preacher and former 
			army captain in the War of 1812--launched the &quot;great second advent 
			awakening&quot; which eventually spread throughout most of the Christian 
			world. Based on his study of the prophecy of Daniel 8:14, Miller 
			calculated that Jesus would return to earth on October 22, 1844. 
			When Jesus did not appear, Miller's followers experienced what 
			became to be called &quot;the Great Disappointment.&quot;</p>
			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			Most of the thousands who had joined the movement, left it, in deep 
			disillusionment. A few, however, went back to their Bibles to find 
			why they had been disappointed. Soon they concluded that the October 
			22 date had indeed been correct, but that Miller had predicted the 
			wrong event for that day. They became convinced that the Bible 
			prophecy predicted not that Jesus would return to earth in 1844, but 
			that He would begin at that time a special ministry in heaven for 
			His followers. They still looked for Jesus to come soon, however, as 
			do Seventh-day Adventists yet today.</p>
			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			From this small group who refused to give up after the &quot;great 
			disappointment&quot; arose several leaders who built the foundation of 
			what would become the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Standing out 
			among these leaders were a young couple--James and Ellen G White -- 
			and a retired sea captain named Joseph Bates.</p>
			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			This small nucleus of &quot;Adventists&quot; began to grow -- mainly in the 
			New England states of America, where Miller's movement had begun. 
			Ellen G White, a mere teenager at the time of the &quot;Great 
			Disappointment,&quot; grew into a gifted author, speaker and 
			administrator, who would become and remain the trusted spiritual 
			counselor of the Adventist family for more than seventy years until 
			her death in 1915. Early Adventists came to believe -- as have 
			Adventists ever since -- that she enjoyed God's special guidance as 
			she wrote her counsels to the growing body of believers.</p>
			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			In 1860, at Battle Creek Michigan, the loosely knit congregations of 
			Adventists chose the name Seventh-day Adventist and in 1863 formally 
			organized a church body with a membership of 3,500. At first, work 
			was largely confined to North America until 1874 when the Church's 
			first missionary, J. N. Andrews, was sent to Switzerland. Africa was 
			penetrated briefly in 1879 when Dr. H. P. Ribton, an early convert 
			in Italy, moved to Egypt and opened a school, but the project ended 
			when riots broke out in the vicinity.</p>
			<p style="margin: 0px 0px 8px; color: rgb(101, 103, 111); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;">
			The first non-Protestant Christian country entered was Russia, where 
			an Adventist minister went in 1886. On October 20, 1890, the 
			schooner Pitcairn was launched at San Francisco and was soon engaged 
			in carrying missionaries to the Pacific Islands. Seventh-day 
			Adventist workers first entered non-Christian countries in 1894 -- 
			Gold Coast (Ghana), West Africa, and Matabeleland, South Africa. The 
			same year saw missionaries entering South America, and in 1896 there 
			were representatives in Japan. The Church now has established work 
			in 209 countries.</p>
